AI Console is an AI-powered personal assistant designed to help you with a wide range of tasks. It combines the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to provide personalized assistance and streamline your workflows.

# Features

### Run Code Locally
Run it locally; the console can perform all the tasks that your machine is capable of executing.

### Improves with Use
Describe in plain text how to perform a given task once, and thereafter AIConsole will know how to execute it indefinitely.

### Utilize Your Notes for AI Training
Employ your notes to instruct the AI in completing and automating tasks.

### Better than Vector Databases
For each step of your tasks, leverage a precise, efficient, and automated multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that is on par with expert prompt engineering.

### Completely Open Sourced
This software does not transmit any data to any parties other than the LLM APIs â€“ and you can confirm this for yourself.

### Share Your Tools with the Community
Develop and share your domain-specific AI tools, for instance, on platforms like GitHub or Discord.
